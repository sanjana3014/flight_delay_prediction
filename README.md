# Flight Delay Prediction

## Overview
This project aims to predict flight delays using machine learning techniques as part of the Machine Learning course under the Work Integrated Learning Programmes - M.Tech Data Science and Engineering at BITS Pilani. The dataset used contains over half a million instances with details about different flights and their delay statuses.

## Dataset

The "Airlines Dataset" used in this project contains the following features:

- **Airline:** Commercial airline name.
  
- **Flight:** Aircraft type.
  
- **AirportFrom:** Source airport.
  
- **AirportTo:** Destination airport.
  
- **DayOfWeek:** Day of the week.
  
- **Time:** Departure time in minutes from midnight.
  
- **Length:** Duration of the flight in minutes.
  
- **Delay:** Binary indicator of delay (Yes/No).

The dataset is available in this repository.

## Project Structure

### 1. Data Preparation

- **Data Importing:** Download and load the dataset into a suitable format for analysis.
  
- **Data Visualization:** Analyze the dataset using various visualization techniques to understand the data's distribution and relationships.
  
- **Data Cleaning:** Handle missing values, outliers, and other anomalies in the dataset.

### 2. Feature Engineering

- **Pre-processing:** Standardize and normalize features where applicable to improve model performance.
  
- **Feature Selection:** Utilize methods to determine the most impactful features for the predictive models.

### 3. Model Development

- **Splitting Dataset:** Divide the data into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets.
  
- **Model Training:** Train Logistic Regression and Decision Tree models to predict flight delays.
  
- **Model Evaluation:** Use metrics such as Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, and ROC-AUC to evaluate model performance.

## Key Findings

- **Performance Insights:** Summary of model performance with key metrics.
  
- **Feature Importance:** Analysis of the features that most significantly impact flight delay predictions.
